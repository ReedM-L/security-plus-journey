My CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification study process, tools, and reflections
This repository documents how I studied for and earned my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification. It includes my study strategy, tools I used, concepts I struggled with, and key takeaways.

## üìç Starting Point

When I first heard of and considered obtaining my Security+ certification I was a freshman in college at Penn State studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations. I had heard mixed views from nearly everyone I asked advice from, some said it wasn't worthwhile while others praised it as being a great introduction. I decided to do research myself and read countless pages of information from CompTIA, Reddit, and LinkedIn. After all of this I came to the conclusion that I wanted to start my journey to obtain my Security+ certification. I had practically no previous experience so this was an entirely new endeavor where I was going to need to learn and apply a vast number of security concepts. My goal was simple: I wanted to actually learn, I wanted to get the certification but I did not want it to become a rush to get a piece of paper, I knew this could be a great foundation for my career in cybersecurity.

## üß∞ Study Tools and Strategy

- Resources Used: Professor Messer, Anki, and CompTIA official materials.
I primarily relied on Professor Messer‚Äôs SY0-701 playlist on YouTube, cross-referencing information with official CompTIA resources. Anki was used for long-term spaced repetition to reinforce key concepts.

- Original Plan: My initial strategy was to watch two videos per day and take detailed notes on each. With 121 videos in total, I aimed to complete the playlist in roughly two months. However, I occasionally fell behind due to slower progress and personal slumps.

- Refining the Approach: I realized that limiting myself to exactly two videos per day was inefficient, as some videos were only 4 minutes long. This restriction made it easy to justify not getting ahead.

- Updated Strategy: I switched to spending one focused hour each day on videos, increasing my completion rate. To prevent information overload, I would review concepts throughout the day and consult additional online resources to clarify questions. I also streamlined my note-taking, focusing on high-value information rather than directly copying every slide into my notes.

## üîê Conceptual Struggles & Breakthroughs

- Security controls, Wireless security settings, Architecture and infrastructure concepts
- These three objectives were particularly challenging for me. They did not click during my initial study, and even after additional research, I struggled to fully grasp them. What really helped was focusing on practice quizzes specifically targeting these objectives. Although it was not easy to isolate them at first, doing so allowed me to understand the contexts in which they are applied. I also found AI chatbots extremely useful. Prompting them with ‚ÄúELI5‚Äù (Explain Like I‚Äôm 5) often produced explanations that were much easier to relate to other familiar concepts.

## üß™ Practice and Labs

- Most of my practice and lab experience came from my classes. For example, setting up and launching a virtual machine was a regular class activity that greatly strengthened my understanding of the concept. In my networking class, experimenting with Wireshark helped me grasp network protocols and remember certain port numbers more easily.

- Outside of class, I rarely performed labs because many concepts required a significant time commitment to set up a lab environment. However, I used Anki nearly every day to reinforce older concepts and maintain long-term retention.

## üß† Exam Day

- I strongly recommend Professor Messer‚Äôs practice exams, as they were extremely helpful and the most reliable way for me to assess my readiness. My exam preparation strategy involved reviewing every term in the CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam Objectives PDF, taking a practice exam, grading it, and reviewing every question, whether I answered it correctly or not. I repeated this process three times, which corresponds to the number of practice exams provided. The practice exams were invaluable because their questions closely mirror the style of the actual exam.

- The most challenging and surprising part of the exam was the Performance Based Questions (PBQs). They are difficult to prepare for and initially felt daunting. My best advice is to review all terms thoroughly. If you feel stressed during the exam, take a breath, move on, and return to the question later. Almost every time I did this, I remembered the answer and completed the question correctly. There will be no terms on the test that are not in the exam objectives, and Professor Messer covers all terms listed in the objectives. Taking your time, reviewing regularly, and testing yourself will ensure success.

- In hindsight, I would have spent more time preparing specifically for PBQ-style questions so they felt less intimidating on exam day.

## üîÑ Final Reflection

- I believe the Security+ certification was worth it because it pushed me to explore a wide-ranging field that can often feel overwhelming.

- My approach to cybersecurity has changed significantly since studying for and taking the Security+ exam. I have realized that constantly worrying or second-guessing yourself can be detrimental. It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of information to learn, but the most important lesson I gained was to take things slowly and focus on long-term growth.

- My next goal is to pursue the CCNA certification, a networking certification offered by Cisco. Compared to Security+, CCNA involves more content and places a heavier emphasis on labs and hands-on configuration, rather than only learning concepts.
