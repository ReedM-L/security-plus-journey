## 📍 Starting Point

When I first heard of and considered obtaining my Security+ certification I was a freshman in college at Penn State studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations. I had heard mixed views from nearly everyone I asked advice from, some said it wasn't worthwhile while others praised it as being a great introduction. I decided to do research myself and read countless pages of information from CompTIA, Reddit, and LinkedIn. After all of this I came to the conclusion that I wanted to start my journey to obtain my Security+ certification. I had practically no previous experience so this was an entirely new endeavor where I was going to need to learn and apply a vast number of security concepts. My goal was simple: I wanted to actually learn, I wanted to get the certification but I did not want it to become a rush to get a piece of paper, I knew this could be a great foundation for my career in cybersecurity.
